<h3>DESCRIPTION:</h3>
</div>
<div id="description" class="hidden">
<p>
ParaTracker is a PHP based server tracker originally created for Jedi Academy, but it can also track many other Quake III games.<br />
All you have to do is put ParaTracker on your web server, make sure it has permission to read and write files and directories, then configure it with the IP address and port of the game server, and optionally, a skin file of your choice.
</p>
<p>
ParaTracker has two modes: <span class="red">Static</span> and <span class="blue">Dynamic</span>.
</p>
<p>
<span class="red">Static</span> mode runs directly from the settings in <span class="green">ParaConfig.php</span>, and none of the options<br />
can be changed by the viewers.</p>
<p>
<span class="blue">Dynamic</span> mode loads all the settings from <span class="green">ParaConfig.php</span>, but it accepts an IP address, port number and skin ID from the end user. This enables other people to use ParaTracker on their own website, without installing it. This mode is a little risky and should be used with caution.
</p>
</div>

<hr class="width55" />

<div onclick="expandCollapse('installationInstructions')" class="cursor">
<h3>INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
</div>
<div id="installationInstructions" class="hidden">
<p>You must have PHP on your web server to use ParaTracker, your web host must allow outgoing connections, and ParaTracker must have permission to read and write files and directories.</p>

<p>To install ParaTracker, just copy all the files from this folder onto your own web server,<br />
and make sure it has enough free space after installation to write files.<br />
For <span class="red">static</span> mode (Only tracking one server, which is the default), you should only need 5 MB of free space or less.<br />
If you are running in <span class="blue">dynamic</span> mode, make sure there are several hundred MB of space available, because every server that is tracked will create a new folder and populate it with server data.</p>
</div>

<hr class="width50" />

<div onclick="expandCollapse('howToUse')" class="cursor">
<h3>HOW TO USE PARATRACKER:</h3>
</div>
<div id="howToUse" class="hidden">

<p>After installing ParaTracker, open <span class="green">ParaConfig.php</span> in a text editor. Set the IP address and port of your server, as well
as any other parameters that you feel like changing.</p>

<p>There are comments throughout <span class="green">ParaConfig.php</span> that explain each feature. RCon is available, but is disabled
by default for security. <span class="blue">Dynamic</span> mode, which enables the user to input their own IP
address and port, is also disabled by default, because it enables other users to use your
website's bandwidth, as well as being a security risk. <strong>DO NOT</strong> enable <span class="blue">dynamic</span> mode unless ParaTracker
is isolated in it's own webroot, as any security holes in ParaTracker could give someone root access
to your web server.</p>

<h3>If you mess something up in <span class="green">ParaConfig.php</span> and you can't figure it out, delete the file and load <span class="green">ParaTrackerStatic.php</span> in your browser. A default file will be generated for you, and you can start over.</h3>

<p>To use ParaTracker in <span class="red">static</span> mode (Running strictly with options from <span class="green">ParaConfig.php</span>), load <span class="green">ParaTrackerStatic.php</span>.</p>

<p>To insert ParaTracker onto a web page in <span class="red">static</span> mode, use the <strong>&lt;object&gt;</strong> tag, with the appropriate size and width settings. For instance:</p>

<h3><span class="red">
&lt;object id="ParaTracker" type="text/html" data="http://www.nab622.com/ParaTracker/<span class="green">ParaTrackerStatic.php</span>" width="<span class="green">675</span>" height="<span class="green">300</span>"&gt;<br />&lt;/object&gt;
</span></h3>

<p>Keep in mind that each skin is a different size; if you want to change skins, you will need to change the size to match.</p>


<p>To use ParaTracker in <span class="blue">dynamic</span> mode, you first have to enable it in <span class="green">ParaConfig.php</span>. Then, load up
<span class="green">ParaTrackerDynamic.php</span> in your web browser. An instruction page will appear that will help you get started.
Remember: other people can use this mode to track their game servers, using your web server as the medium.</p>


<p>All RCon usage is logged in the /logs folder. Inside the logs folder will be a folder named after the server
IP address and port number of the server, and inside that folder will be <span class="green">RConLog.php</span>. For security reasons,
you cannot load this file from a web browser - you must download it to your computer, and open it in a text editor. All attempts at RCon access will be logged.</p>
</div>

<div onclick="expandCollapse('levelshots')" class="cursor">
<h3>LEVELSHOTS:</h3>
</div>
<div id="levelshots" class="hidden">

<p>
ParaTracker will accept custom levelshots for any game it is able to track. It will automatically search for levelshots in a folder named after the game. The levelshots must be stored in:<br />
<span class="red">/images/levelshots/&lt;GameName&gt;</span><br />
So, if you were adding levelshots for <span class="blue">Jedi Academy</span>, you would put them in:<br />
<span class="red">/images/levelshots/jedi academy</span></p>

<p>Levelshots can be <span class="green">.png</span>, <span class="green">.jpg</span> or <span class="green">.gif</span> (And yes, you can animate the .gifs). ParaTracker will look for <span class="green">PNG</span> first, <span class="green">JPG</span> second, and <span class="green">GIF</span> last, and use whichever one it finds first.</p>
<p>If you only have one levelshot, you can just name it after the map name, and ParaTracker will find it.<br />
If you have more than one levelshot, add a <span class="green">_1</span> to the end of the filename of the first one, <span class="green">_2</span> to the end of the second one, and so on.<br />
So, if the map is <span class="red">mp/ffa3</span>, and you have 3 PNG levelshots, you would name them:<br />
<span class="red">ffa3</span><span class="green">_1</span><span class="red">.png</span>, <span class="red">ffa3</span><span class="green">_2</span><span class="red">.png</span>, and <span class="red">ffa3</span><span class="green">_3</span><span class="red">.png</span>, and put them in an /mp subfolder.</p>

<p>By default, ParaTracker supports 20 levelshots, and can support up to 99 levelshots, but nobody will stick around to view that many, so you should keep it to a decent amount.

<p>ParaTracker can use any resolution levelshot, but to keep the size reasonable and save on bandwidth, you should make them all the standard resolution of <span class="blue">300 x 225</span>.</p>

<p>Also, if you open ParaTracker on a web page and click on a levelshot, the tracker will immediately transition to the next levelshot with no delay.</p>

<hr class="width40" />

<div onclick="expandCollapse('housekeeping')" class="cursor">
<h3>HOUSEKEEPING:</h3>
</div>
<div id="housekeeping" class="hidden">

<p>ParaTracker writes the server data it receives to several files and folders, and if it is loaded before the
floodprotect time has elapsed, it will serve up the old data again. As long as the IP address and port number
of the server do not change, the files will be overwritten with every refresh, and everything should be
dandy. However, when ParaTracker runs in <span class="blue">dynamic</span> mode, it will make a new folder for every IP address
the users attempt to use. For flood protection reasons, this has to exist, even though it causes a lot of
extra files to be written.</p>

<p>These files are very small; however, if they take up too much space, you can simply delete the entire <span class="green">info/</span>
folder. ParaTracker will re-generate the necessary info the next time it runs.</p>

<p>RCon logs are the same way. They shouldn't get very large, and you shouldn't delete them, but if the need
should arise, just delete the entire <span class="green">logs/</span> folder, and new information will be generated the next time ParaTracker is run.</p>
