Title: ParaTracker 1.0 RC

Authors: Parabolic Mind - NAB622, Phazmatis, Cagelight

Date released: 11/22/2016

__________________________________________

DESCRIPTION:

ParaTracker is a server tracker created for Jedi Academy, but it can also track most other Quake III servers. It runs on PHP, and the user must upload it to their own website and add it to their web page.

__________________________________________

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

You must have PHP on your web server to use ParaTracker.
Copy ParaTracker's files onto your website, and then add a DIV or a frame somewhere that
references the file "ParaTracker-A.php".

Then, open ParaConfig.php in a text editor. Set the IP address and port of your server, as well
as any other parameters that you feel like changing. RCon is available, but is disabled by default
for security.

Please find them for me. I've found and fixed a ton already, but I'm sure I'm missing many more.
