// ParaTracker Configuration //
///////////////////////////////

// This is the config file for ParaTracker.
// The only visual setting found here is the frame border.
// If you want to edit fonts and colors, they are found
// in ParaStyle.css and the ParaSkin.css files, not here.

// ONLY modify the variables defined below, between the double quotes!
// Changing anything else can break the tracker!

// If this file ever breaks and you have no idea what is wrong, just delete it.
// When ParaTracker is run, it will write a new one for you.

// If you find any exploits in the code, please bring them to my attention immediately!
// Thank you and enjoy!


// NETWORK SETTINGS
// NETWORK SETTINGS

// This is the IP Address of the server. Do not include the port number!
// By default, and for security, this value is empty. If ParaTracker is launched without a value here,
// it will display a message telling the user to check config.php before running.
$serverIPAddress = "212.224.101.83";


// Port number of the server. The default port for Jedi Academy is 29070. Another common port is 21000.
// The default port number for Jedi Outcast is 28070.
// If an invalid entry is given, this value will default to 29070.
$serverPort = "";

// This variable limits how many seconds are required between each snapshot of the server.
// This prevents high traffic on the tracker from bogging down the game server it is tracking.
// ParaTracker forces a minimum value of 5 seconds between snapshots. Maximum is 1200 seconds.
// This value cannot be lower than the value of $connectionTimeout (below).
// Default is 15 seconds.
$floodProtectTimeout = "15";

// This value is the number of seconds ParaTracker will wait for a response from the game server
// before timing out. Note that, every time the tracker gets data from the server, it will ALWAYS
// wait the full delay time. Server connections are UDP, so the tracker cannot tell when the data
// stream is complete. After this time elapses, ParaTracker will assume it has all the data and
// parse it. If your web server has a slow response time to the game server, set this value
// higher. ParaTracker forces a minimum value of 1 second, and will not allow values over 15 seconds.
// Not recommended to go above 5 seconds, as people will get impatient and leave.
// This setting also affects RCon wait times.
// Default is 2.5 seconds.
$connectionTimeout = "2.5";

// This value, given in seconds, determines how long ParaTracker will wait for a current refresh of
// the server info to complete, before giving up and forcing another one. Raise this value if your
// web server is busy or slow to reduce the load on the game server.
// Minimum is 1 second, maximum is 15 seconds.
// Default is 3 seconds.
$refreshTimeout = "3";


// LEVELSHOT SETTINGS
// LEVELSHOT SETTINGS

// Levelshots will be searched for on the web server in the images/levelshots folder.
// If the map is mp/ffa5, ParaTracker will search for images in images/levelshots/mp/ffa5.

// For levelshots to fade, they will have to be named with _1, _2, and _3 at the end of the file name.
// For instance, to have three fading levelshots for mp/ffa5, the files would have to be in
// the images/levelshots/mp folder, and they would need to be named ffa5_1.jpg, ffa5_2.jpg,
// and ffa5_3.jpg

// ParaTracker will use any combination of PNG, JPG, and GIF images. PNGs will be used first, JPGs second,
// and GIFs third. If no images are found, a placeholder image will be displayed instead.

// The following value will enable or disable fading levelshots. A value of 1 or "Yes" will allow them,
// and any other value with disable them. If this is disabled, only the first levelshot will show.
// Default value is 1.
$fadeLevelshots = "1";

// This is the amount of time, in seconds, each levelshot will be displayed before moving on to the next.
// Decimals are acceptable. Minimum is 1 second. Maximum is 15 seconds.
// Default is 3 seconds.
$levelshotDisplayTime = "3";

// This is the amount of time, in second, each levelshot will take to fade into the next one.
// Note that fades do not work in some browsers, like Internet Explorer 8.
// Decimals are acceptable. Minimum is 0.1 seconds. Maximum is 5 seconds.
// Default is .5 seconds.
$levelshotTransitionTime = ".5";

// This is the frame rate at which levelshots will transition. Higher values are smoother,
// and lower values are choppier. Values between 10 and 30 are good. A value of 1 will
// disable the fading and give a "slide show" feel.
// Any value below 1 is forbidden. Values above 60 are also forbidden.
// Default is 30 FPS.
$levelshotFPS = "30";

// The following value is the maximum number of levelshots that can be used. Keep in mind that
// more levelshots is not always better. Minimum is 1, maximum is 99.
// Default is 20 levelshots.
$maximumLevelshots = "20";


// TRACKER SETTINGS
// TRACKER SETTINGS

// This value is boolean. When this variable is set to Yes or 1, offending symbols will be
// filtered from the server name. Currently the only affected symbol is the Euro symbol, .
// Default is 1.
$filterOffendingServerNameSymbols = "1";

// This is the name of the game being tracked; I.E. Jedi Academy, Jedi Outcast, Call Of Duty 4, etc.
// It is displayed underneath the server name in the top left corner of the tracker.
// For future-proofing, this value is left to you, the user.
// The levelshots derive their directory from this value, so make sure it is correct! For instance,
// a value of "Jedi Academy" means ParaTracker will look for levelshots in "images/levelshots/jedi academy"
// Default is "Jedi Academy"
$gameName = "Jedi Academy";

// No Players Online Message
// This message displays in place of the player list when nobody is online.
// Default is "No players online."
$noPlayersOnlineMessage = "No players online.";

// ParaTracker can automatically refresh itself every so often.
// This will not cause any disruption to the game, because the flood protection
// limits how often ParaTracker will contact the server.
// A value of Yes or 1 will enable it, and any other value will disable it.
// Enabled by default.
$enableAutoRefresh = "1";

// This value determines how many seconds ParaTracker waits between refreshes.
// This value cannot be lower than the value in $floodProtectTimeout, or 10 seconds, whichever is greater.
// Decimals are invalid and will be rounded.
// It also cannot be higher than 300 seconds.
// Default is 30 seconds.
$autoRefreshTimer = "30";

// This variable will set the maximum number of characters ParaTracker will accept from the server.
// This prevents pranksters from sending 50MB back, in the unlikely event that you connect to
// the wrong server. Minimum is 2000 characters, maximum is 50000 characters.
// Default is 4000 characters.
$maximumServerInfoSize = "4000";

// This next setting enables "Dynamic" ParaTracker. Clients can load "ParaTrackerDynamic.php" and give
// an IP address, port number and visual theme ID in the URL, and ParaTracker will connect to that server.
// For instance, "YourWebsiteNameHere.com/ParaTrackerDynamic.php?ip=192.168.1.100&port=29070&skin=ParaTrackerA&game=Jedi%20Academy"
// DO *NOT*, I REPEAT, DO *NOT* ENABLE THIS FEATURE UNLESS YOU WANT PEOPLE USING YOUR WEBSITE TO TRACK THEIR SERVERS.
// Also, DO NOT run ParaTracker in this mode without isolating it in its own webroot first - the consequences
// can be grave if there is a security hole that I have not yet found!
// If you do not understand what this feature is, DO NOT enable it.
// A value of Yes or 1 will enable it, and any other value will disable it.
// Disabled by default.
$dynamicTrackerEnabled = "1";

// The following setting is a personal message that will be displayed on ParaTrackerDynamic.php when a user is setting
// up ParaTracker for their own use. By default, this is simply a link to our GitHub, where you can download the program
// for free. The point is to encourage as many people as possible to run the software themselves, and not to rely on Dynamic
// mode too much.
// Default is: "ParaTracker is free, open-source software! Download your own at http://github.com/ParabolicMinds/ParaTracker"
$personalDynamicTrackerMessage = "ParaTracker is free, open-source software! Download your own at http://github.com/ParabolicMinds/ParaTracker";


// RCON SETTINGS

// This value will enable or disable RCon.
// A value of Yes or 1 will enable it, and any other value will disable it.
// Disabled by default for security.
$RConEnable = "1";

// This value sets the maximum number of characters ParaTracker will send to the server.
// If the command or password is any larger than this, the command will not be sent.
// Minimum is 20 characters, maximum is 10000 characters.
// Default is 100 characters.
$RConMaximumMessageSize = "100";

// RCon flood protection forces the user to wait a certain number of seconds before sending another command.
// Note that this is not user-specific; if someone else is using your RCon, you may have to wait a bit to
// send the command. Minimum is 10 seconds, maximum is 3600.
// Cannot be lower than the value of $connectionTimeout.
// Default is 20 seconds.
$RConFloodProtect = "20";

// RCon events are logged in RConLog.php for security. This variable will determine
// the maximum number of lines that will be stored in the log file before the old
// entries are truncated. Minimum is 100 lines. Maximum is 100000.
// Default is 1000 lines.
$RConLogSize = "1000";


// POPUP WINDOW SETTINGS
// POPUP WINDOW SETTINGS

// This value is boolean. When the RCon and PARAM buttons are clicked, the popup
// window will snap to the top left corner of the screen by default. When this
// variable is set to any value other than Yes or 1, the behavior is disabled.
// Does not appear to work correctly in Google Chrome.
// Default is 0.
